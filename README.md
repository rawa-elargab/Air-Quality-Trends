# Air-Quality-Trends

Air Quality Index is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms, which are easy to understand. It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and colour. The various AQI categories are decided based on ambient concentration values of air pollutants and their likely health impacts (known as health breakpoints). AQ sub-index and health breakpoints are evolved for multiple pollutants such as PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, etc. Based on the measured ambient concentrations of a pollutant, sub-index is calculated, which is a linear function of concentration. The worst sub-index determines the overall AQI.
Data Collation

This data is a collection from Continuous

Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMs) covering Residential,
Commercial, Industrial and Silence Zones by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The Air Quality is being monitored round the clock, 24 hours a day for the Primary and secondary pollutants as well as Meteorological parameters.

This dataset provides comprehensive air quality monitoring data for the city of Bangalore, India. The dataset contains hourly measurements of various air pollutants and meteorological parameters recorded at multiple monitoring stations across Bangalore.
